# Demo Album â€“ Notes

- This folder is safe to commit. The produced audio files will go to `projects/demo-album/output/` which is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- You can tweak `project.yml` and re-run the splitter to refine titles and starts.

Quick run:
```bash
python -m smart_splitter.cli run projects/demo-album/project.yml
```
